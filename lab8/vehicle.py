        Moves the vehicle fast if there is sufficient energy.
        Randomly selects a value between min and max speed for the number of spaces to move.
        Deducts 5 energy for the move. If the movement is less than the distance to the next obstacle,
        the vehicle moves that amount. Otherwise, it crashes into the obstacle and stops just before it.

        Parameters:
        dist (int): The distance to the next obstacle.
